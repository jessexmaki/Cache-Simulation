# CDA3101-CacheSimulation

This is a cache simulator project for a programming assignment. The purpose of this simulator is to read a memory access trace from a file and determine whether each memory access is a hit or a miss. After determining the hit or miss, the simulator will output the hit rate of the memory access trace.

The simulator is implemented using C++. 

## Cache Designs

The simulator will analyze the performance (hit rate) of three cache designs.
* direct mapped
* n-way associative
* fully associative
